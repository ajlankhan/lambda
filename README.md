# lambda
A modified turing based programming language where everything needs to be defined even mathematical operators or logical operators. A language which can be completely morphed by the syntax being executed and is purely programmer oriented.

Uses concepts of Turing machine and Lambda calculus in a modified form. The simplest programming language which in turn will also be the most powerful programming language !

Intended Features and Uses:
  - Virtual register enables complete data protection even within the program itself.
  - The virutal register always retains its values/data, so, No need to manually save anything. Program always resumes from last state.
  - The interpreter
  - Since, the register is virtually infinite, so, by default, the language is lazy.

Keywords :
  shift : move data from one block to another only if it is empty
  clear : clears data stored in a block 
  let : assigns a name (variable) and stores its value in a fixed empty block (automatically allocated), now that block is invisible to any other process or      
         function which doesnt need it
  met : describes a method
  
Note :
  Keywords can have suffixes as parameters that defines their final behavior. Eg. shift -f shifts the data irrespective of occupancy of target block.
